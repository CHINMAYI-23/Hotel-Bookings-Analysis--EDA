Business Problem:

In recent years, City Hotel and Resort Hotel have seen high cancellation rates. Each hotel is 
now dealing with a number of issues as a result, including fewer revenues and less than ideal 
hotel room use. Consequently, lowering cancellation rates is both hotel's primary goal in 
order to increase their efficiency in generating revenue, and for us to offer thorough business 
advice to address this problem.

4. The biggest factor affecting the effectiveness of earning income is booking 
cancellations
5. Cancellation result in vacant rooms for the booked length of time
